# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### dropdownMenu explaination

The DropdownMenu component is a simple React functional component that renders a dropdown menu with options and tracks the selected option using state.

Here's an explanation of the component:

1. The DropdownMenu component imports React and the useState hook from React.
2. It defines a functional component called DropdownMenu.
3. Inside the component, it initializes a state variable called selectedOption using the useState hook. The initial value is an empty string ('').
4. The component defines a function called handleOptionChange, which is triggered when the user selects an option from the dropdown. It updates the selectedOption state with the value of the selected option.
5. The render function of the component displays a container div and a heading that says "Should you use a dropdown?".
6. Inside the container div, there is a select element (dropdown) with the value attribute set to the selectedOption state and the onChange event handler set to the handleOptionChange function.
7. Within the select element, there are several option elements. The first option is conditionally rendered based on the selectedOption state. If a value is selected, it displays the selectedOption value; otherwise, it displays "-Select-". This provides a default placeholder option when no option is selected.
8. The subsequent option elements represent the available options in the dropdown menu. Each option has a value attribute set to a unique value ('option1', 'option2', 'option3') and displays a corresponding label ('Yes', 'Probably not', 'Why not?').

In summary, the DropdownMenu component renders a dropdown menu and keeps track of the selected option using state. The user can select an option from the dropdown, and the selected option is stored in the selectedOption state variable.
